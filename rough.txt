IF THE USER WANT TO SAVE THE SUMMARY IN HIS ACCOUNT, BELOW IS THE POSSIBLE WAY OF DOING IT.




That's a great idea! This moves your project from a simple tool into a personalized, multi-user application.

To make this possible, we need to add two major components that aren't in the current setup:

User Authentication: We need a secure way to know who is saving the summary.

User Database: We need a database (separate from your ChromaDB vector store) to store that specific user's saved summaries.

We can accomplish this using Firebase, which is standard for this environment. Here's the plan:

Client-Side (Your Front-End): Your HTML/JavaScript client will use Firebase Authentication to sign in. When it calls your API, it will include a special ID Token in the Authorization header.

Back-End (main.py): Your FastAPI application will use the Firebase Admin SDK to: a. Receive and verify that ID Token to identify the user. b. Use Firestore (as the "account database") to save the summary to a private collection belonging only to that user.

I've updated main.py to include a new /save-summary endpoint that handles all of this. It requires the user to send their url and a category (the "particular place" you mentioned) to save it to.

Here are the modifications for main.py:

This new code adds the Firebase Admin SDK, a security dependency to verify users, and the /save-summary endpoint you wanted.

You'll need to set up the Admin SDK on your backend (by providing the service account key) and then update your front-end to send the user's Firebase ID token, but this provides the complete API structure to make it work.
